To maintain a positive and inclusive community, all contributors are expected to:

- Be respectful, kind, and patient when interacting with others.
- Welcome feedback and engage in constructive discussions.
- Avoid discriminatory or offensive language.
- Focus on collaboration and problem-solving rather than criticism.

- Report any violations or concerns to the maintainers privately.

Let’s work together to make MyBrandName a project where everyone feels valued and supported.
